Index the current working directory and show:

1. A tree structure of all files and folders
2. Contents of files at the root level only
3. Subdirectories show only their structure (no file contents)

Use the tree_indexer tool with:

- path: {{directory}}
- maxFileSize: 102400 (100KB)

Show the user the formatted markdown output.
